# Light Bootstrap Dashboard Angular CLI Real World

This is a re-implementation of the [Light-Bootstrap-Dashboard-Angular2](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/light-bootstrap-dashboard-angular). 

The project has Authfunctionality using Json Web Tokens and CRUD functionality for articles. This is from the awesome [GoThinkster Real World Example App](https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app)

Dashboard template from [creative-tim](http://www.creative-tim.com/), see their GitHub for more information. It has been written to be a bit more component-focused and to work better with Angular CLI.
